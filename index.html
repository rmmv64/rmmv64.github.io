<h1>Rachel's Basic Webpage </h1>
<p> My final project will hopefully be a redesigned online portfolio that I create from scratch. Here is a list of the things I need to include on my final webpage: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>About Me</li>
		<li>Resume</li>
		<li>Work</li>
		<li>Contact</li>
	</ul>

  <p style="color:#800000">I like hosting services such as WordPress and SquareSpace, but I want my portfolio to be completely customizable - me in a website. I also want to be able to say that I made it myself because coding is a skill that not a lot of people in my career field have. Here are a couple of examples of online portfolios I've found that appear to be manually coded. I like the design and organizational elements of each.
<h2>Alyssa Ramirez</h2>
<p> Alyssa's <a href="alyssaramirezpr.com">portfolio</a> includes all of the components that I would want to include in mine. Instead of being organized into one page, she uses tabs to display her resumé, work and contact information. The tabs even have drop-down menus when necessary. Overall, I think her portfolio is professional, easy to use and visually appealing.
  <br>
  Below is a quote that Alyssa keeps on her home page. I'm sure it inspires her and she hopes it will do the same for those who visit her site. </p>
  <blockquote>"Bring the best of your authentic self to every opportunity." - John Jantsch, author of Duct Tape Marketing</blockquote>

  <p style="color:#ff9933">There's not much else to say about my portfolio and what I want it to be. The functionality and ease of navigation are a lot more important to me than design elements, though I do think personal branding is pertinent to my field. More than anything, I want to walk away from this class feeling like I've learned skills that will last me a lifetime.
  </p>
<h2>Laura Kern</h2>
<p> Laura's <a href="lauraskern.com">portfolio</a> reads more like a blog, but it still has all of the essential components of a professional website. I don't like the design as much as Alyssa's, but I can appreciate the simplicity of her minimalist color scheme. The blocks of text are easy to read.
  <br>
  Below is a quote that I think would resonate with Laura and anyone who visits her site. It's from a well-known master of advertising and one of the people I look up to most.</p>
  <blockquote>"Curiosity about life, in all its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people." – Leo Burnett</blockquote>
