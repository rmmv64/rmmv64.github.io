  <h2>MOJO Ad</h2>
  <p>As a content manager for <a href="https://mojo-ad.com/">MOJO Ad</a>, I am responsible for all long-form writing, both creative and strategic. In my six months with the agency, I spearheaded a campaign to recruit new businesses for potential future partnerships. This campaign included several written deliverables such as a Meet MOJO booklet, CMO direct address letter and a three-tiered email campaign for points of contact. Additionally, I am responsible for copy editing all written materials before they are sent out. This everything from recruitment emails to blog posts. The role of content manager has many names (copy editor, consistency captain, etc), and I do them all. I've created content calendards and deadline schedules, written presentation scripts and pitches, and even helped design/code a new webpage for the MOJO Ad website. Although I have my hands in a lot of cookie jars, I am particularly proud of one project this semester: the 2017 State of the YAYA (Youth and Young Adult market) research report.This 55-page report is an accumulation of all research and insights collected from a 500-city survey the agency sent out earlier this year. These numbers manifested into valuable consumer insights and implicatios for marketers - the kind of information you can only get from MOJO Ad. The final report will be available in February 2017, at which time I am proud to say I will also be one of four staff members to present an interantinal webinar about the report.</p>

  <h2>Monsanto Europe</h2>
  <p>As a corporate communications intern for <a href="http://www.monsanto.com/pages/default.aspx">Monsanto</a> in Europe, I was primarily responsible for updating the <a href="http://monsantoblog.eu/">company blog</a> as well as monitoring all social media platforms with the help fo FleishmanHillard, a PR and advertising agency that contracts with Monsanto on external communications. During my time there, I also write several <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150604006586/en/Monsanto-Ranks-Workplaces-Europe">press releases</a>and internal memos, and I campaigned for the creation of a Monsanto Europe Instagram, which I started and trained all communications staff how to use and monitor.
